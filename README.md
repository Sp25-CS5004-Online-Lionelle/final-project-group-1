# Final Project for CS 5004 - (APPLICATION NAME/Update)

(remove this and add your sections/elements)
This readme should contain the following information: 

* The group member's names and link to their personal githubs
* James Hicks
* Ruben Salido
* Nick Gjerasi
* John Vernon

* A program with a GUI that allows users to utilize OMDbâ€™s open API to find movies and their posters (if available) which they may then export into a file. This program could be used to maintain a movie watch list. Users may be able to add or remove movies from their watchlist within the GUI. The watchlist will be persistent and able to be accessed upon launch of the application automatically. We are planning on utilizing a GUI as the main interface for users to utilize our program. This GUI will provide the ability to make and manager lists and save them to an output file.

* Implementation Phases
1. Completion of the model - 4/06
2. Prototype of the Controller / View - 4/11
3. Completion of the Model /Controller / View (project done) - 4/13
4. Completion of ALL documentation by 4/15


* Links to design documents and manuals
* Instructions on how to run the application

Ask yourself, if you started here in the readme, would you have what you need to work on this project and/or use the application?
